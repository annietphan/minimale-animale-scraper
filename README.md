# Minimale Animale Coverup Web Scraper

Since it's festival season in Los Angeles, we're going to be scraping my favorite swimwear brand, Minimale Animale, to display a list of all coverups for pool parties or to layer over a body suit for the actual festival itself.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Fork and clone the repo and if prompted, install missing gems

```
bundle install
```

Run the program

```
ruby bin/coverup
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
